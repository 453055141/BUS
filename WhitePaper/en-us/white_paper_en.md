#  BCOO CHAIN
**A New Distributed Web Protocol Based on an Innovative Proof of Reputation (PoR) Consensus Algorithm and Eco System**

**Abstract**：Bitconch chain proposed an innovative POR (Proof Of Reputation) reputation consensus algorithm, which offers a new solution that leverage blockchain technology to maintain both high throughput and decentralization. According to social graphs, Bitconch blockchain mathematically models social network, time, and contribution activities to build a decentralized reputation system, which offer a chance to transform the above items into every single user’ reputation value. The higher the user's reputation, the lower the transaction cost (or even free of charge), and also has more opportunities to be selected as trust nodes to participate in the consensus and win better benefits. Users with high-reputation are defined as “Mutual Trust Nodes”, who can start “payment channels” for high-speed offline transactions through micro-transactions.

The reputation system and incentive system will effectively promote the continuous engagement of business developers and users, which also contribute to the construction of the business ecosystem. Business developers who generate traffic are more likely to get high reputation values, and better chances of being elected to a trusted full node. By actively engaging in social interactions or other commercial activities (via DApp on blockchain), users can increase their chances of being as Trusted Light Node, which will give user a privilege of sharing system reward.

Several technologies are used by the Bitconch blockchain to maintain the decentralization of the system, while increasing the scalability: DAG (directed acyclic graph) data structure, Zero-Knowledge-Proof, distributed data storage, post-quantum encryption algorithm, and BVM(Bitconch Virtual Machine, which is an enhanced virtual machine for smart contract). All these innovations make Bitconch chain a more reliable and developer friendly platform. DApp and sidechain developer can create awesome DApps which support large file storage, low transaction costs, user information protection, sidechain and smart contract iterations, and easy-bug-fixing. Bitconch chain is a decentralized network with no block and no chain, which solves two difficulties in the application of blockchain: scalability and decentralization. Bitconch chain, is the most feasible blockchain ecosystem for high-frequency micro-transactions and related applications on blockchain, which can be applied to the commercial application of more than 10 million users.

# 1. BACKGROUND

The birth of Bitcoin has made blockchain technology leap from pure theoretical research to the world's focal point of innovation and technology. Blockchain technology has initiated new ways to understand security and information usage and is now widely viewed as certain to dramatically change the world. The success of Ethereum and its Solidity language has permitted creation of Turing-complete smart contracts and allowed developers to create any kind of application to run on a blockchain.  However, the Merkle-tree architectures used by Ethereum, Bitcoin and others suffer from several limitations and these are what is holding them back from large-scale commercial adoption. These are:

- Simultaneous support for scalability, decentralization and security in one architecture. Only two are possible with Merkle-tree architectures
- Limited file storage
- Low Transaction Cost combined with Effective Incentives
- Upgradable Smart Contract
- Usability

# 2. THE CHALLENGE OF BLOCKCHAIN IN APPLICATIONS

## 2.1 HIGH CONCURRENCY, HIGH THROUGHPUT AND SCALABILITY

The core of business competition is volume competition. A successful business project will have more than 10 million registered users and more than one million active users.  Merkle-tree based blockchain architectures are severely limited in the speed and volume of transactions that can be processed. They are inherently not scalable without sacrificing their decentralization or security features. The fairly recent recognition of this has led to a burst of activity by these types of architectures (most notably Ethereum) to try to overcome these issues. Concurrently, the search for alternative architectures that support the decentralization, non-repudiation, and security features of Merkle-tree architectures is a source of huge technical activity and innovation. In the commercial world, the ability to support system throughput in the range of tens of thousands of transactions per second –the current volume and speed Visa/MasterCard support – is expected of any potential replacement technology.

## 2.2 REPUTATION AND USER PRIVACY

Blockchain technology was hailed for its anonymity. By hiding the identity of the users, Blockchain can protect the peers’ privacy. However, in real business applications, pure anonymity may bring problems such as fraud, breach of contract, and difficulty in defending rights. When a user chooses a service provider, they have the right to know whether the service provider is honest and trustworthy.

## 2.3 INCENTIVE MECHANISM AND TRANSACTION COSTS

The business application scenario is mainly for high-frequency small and micro-transactions for a range of small and medium-sized users, so transaction costs will become an important consideration. The transaction cost of Bitcoin has exceeded $1/transaction and the transaction cost of Ethereum is 0.01~0.02ETH/transaction, which is about 5~10 USD/transaction. Excessive transaction costs are clearly unable to meet the commercial needs of high-frequency micro-transactions.

Consumers may wish to use the resources on the blockchain platform for free or at low price, but there is a clear conundrum for a decentralized system: there is no central authority to maintain the cost of transacting on the system, so it is essential to have an effective incentive mechanism which keeps the peers – nodes performing transactions – participating in the activities that keep the system as a whole working. The peers therefore need adequate incentive to provide payment for operation costs, including equipment and utility fees. The participation and therefore the type and degree of incentives for peers is key to operating a truly self-sustaining decentralized system. How to effectively balance the incentive needs for operating the system and secure and genuine decentralization is key to a sustainable platform.
